# Helsinki Neonatal EEG Dataset

This folder is gitignored and intended to store the **Helsinki University Hospital neonatal EEG dataset**, used in our reproduction of *Attention-Based Network for Weak Labels in Neonatal Seizure Detection* (Isaev et al., 2020).

## Dataset Summary

- EEG recordings from **79 term neonates** admitted to the NICU
- Recorded at **Helsinki University Hospital**
- Median recording length: **74 minutes** (IQR: 64â€“96 min)
- EEGs were annotated by **three human experts**
- **39 infants** had seizures by consensus; **22 were seizure-free**
- Seizures were manually labeled, with **~460 seizures per expert**
- Includes **multi-channel EEG in EDF format**, plus seizure annotation files

This dataset serves as a benchmark for:
- Automated neonatal seizure detection
- Inter-observer variability studies
- Temporal/spatial EEG analysis
